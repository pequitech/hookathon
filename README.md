# Hookathon
Hackable request inspector and storage

## About
Hookathon was built to storage requests and let developers redirect them to any target host (included local ones), so you can for example integrates a Github Webhook with your local environment without opening ports and expose your network to unwanted risks. The project started with the name of [Localhook](http://github.com/renoirfaria/localhook) and on early 2018 [Renoir dos Reis](http://github.com/renoirfaria) and [Marcelo Bernardes](http://github.com/mmbdeng) organized a small hackathon to get the core concepts of localhook out of the papers, thats how Hookathons was born.

### Desktop Client (alpha)
Our engineers are working on a client that fetchs requests on your bin and automatically redirects them to a desired target host (yes you can choose anywhere), since the client runs on your machine you can redirect requests to localhosted environments out of the box. The desktop client is a separated project called (pequitech/Hookclient)[https://github.com/pequitech/hookclient]
